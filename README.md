google-translate-website-translator-code-review
===============================================

After spending a bit of time working with the Google Translate Website Translator embed code, I decided to tear it down
and see what it looked like under the hood.  It's an excellent tool for a fairly adequate service, and the ease of use
is top-notch.  

The original code has been optimized and minified, obscured to a very unenjoyable reading experience.

The files included in this repo are my own personal explorations into the code, which is an on-going process.  
I've tried to retain a copy of the original as well as provide legible, commented code wherever possible.
This code is current as of when it is committed, so check your own source for the most up-to-date version
